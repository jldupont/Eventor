Event bridge - listens to UDP 6666 on multicast IP 239.0.0.1 and bridges messages to the system DBus

Installation
============
There are 3 methods:

1. Use the Ubuntu Debian repository [jldupont](https://launchpad.net/~jldupont/+archive/jldupont)  with the package "eventor"

2. Download a 'tag' from the git repo

3. Use the "Download Source" function of this git repo

Note that option #3 isn't preferred as one might get an "unstable" snapshot. 


Usage
=====

Just execute the application. 

Notes
=====

This application isn't very useful by itself.  I use "AndroidEventor" and "Squeezebox Utils" in cooperation with this application.
